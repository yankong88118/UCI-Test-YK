VBA Homework
Here is a thing I went through: When I ran the script, the color formating did not work very well. One time it wokred on the test data, but did not work on the stock data. Or it did not worked for the first time I run the data, but worked for the second time - I did not change anything, just hit "run" again. I don't know what happened. Please help.
