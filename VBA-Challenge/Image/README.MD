I tried the challenge part, but the result is pretty funny. I don't know is that because the logic or the way I write the script. 
When I did the test, I set the Looping row from 2 to 10. I got the correct result. However, when I expanded the row to 20, the result started becoming weird. I don't understand why.  Please help me to figure out. Thank you!
